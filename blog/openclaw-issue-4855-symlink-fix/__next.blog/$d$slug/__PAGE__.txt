This issue had accumulated 10+ upvotes and 29 comments on GitHub, with confirmed reports across macOS, Linux, and Windows. The maintainer acknowledged that symlink-based version managers had never been considered in their testing pipeline, making this a significant gap in platform coverage."},{"heading":"Root Cause Analysis","body":"The root cause lives in how Node.js handles process.argv[1] with symlinks. When you run a globally-installed CLI tool through nvm, the argv[1] value preserves the symlink path (e.g., ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22/bin/openclaw) rather than resolving to the real target. The candidateDirsFromArgv1() function in openclaw-root.ts uses path.resolve() to normalize this path, but path.resolve() does NOT follow symlinks — it only resolves relative segments. So the directory walk-up starts from the bin/ directory of the version manager and never finds the package.json with name: \"openclaw\", causing the asset resolution to fail entirely.","code":{"language":"typescript","content":"function candidateDirsFromArgv1(argv1: string): string[] {\n  const normalized = path.resolve(argv1);\n  const candidates = [path.dirname(normalized)];\n  // .bin logic only — never reaches the real package root\n  // when argv1 is a symlink!\n}"}},{"heading":"The Fix","body":"The fix is elegant in its simplicity: call fs.realpathSync() after path.resolve() to follow the symlink chain to the actual file. If the resolved path differs from the original, its directory is added as an additional candidate for package root discovery. The try/catch ensures backward compatibility — if realpathSync throws (e.g., the path doesn't exist), the original behavior is preserved exactly. This pattern already existed in the codebase: realpathSync was used for execPath resolution in control-ui-assets.ts, so the fix follows established conventions. I also propagated the moduleUrl parameter to the async resolver for completeness, matching the sync resolver's existing API surface.","code":{"language":"typescript","content":"function candidateDirsFromArgv1(argv1: string): string[] {\n  const normalized = path.resolve(argv1);\n  const candidates = [path.dirname(normalized)];\n\n  // Resolve symlinks for version managers (nvm, fnm, n, Homebrew)\n  try {\n    const resolved = fsSync.realpathSync(normalized);\n    if (resolved !== normalized) {\n      candidates.push(path.dirname(resolved));\n    }\n  } catch { /* keep original candidates */ }\n\n  // .bin logic...\n}"}},{"heading":"Testing & Validation","body":"I added three focused test cases that create real symlinks via fs.symlinkSync with relative targets — matching how nvm and fnm actually set up their symlink structures. The tests validate that resolveOpenClawPackageRoot(), resolveControlUiRootSync(), and resolveControlUiDistIndexPath() all correctly follow symlinks to find assets. Tests gracefully skip on Windows CI environments where symlink creation may require elevated privileges.","table":{"headers":["Check","Result"],"rows":[["Vitest (17/17 tests)","All pass (14 existing + 3 new)"],["tsgo --noEmit","Clean — no type errors"],["oxlint (3 changed files)","0 warnings, 0 errors"],["oxfmt --check","All correctly formatted"],["git status","Clean working tree"]]}},{"heading":"Platform Coverage","body":"One of the most satisfying aspects of this fix is its breadth.

Here are the key trade-offs I navigated and why each choice was made:","list":["Fixed at the lowest level (candidateDirsFromArgv1) so ALL callers benefit — both sync and async resolvers, health checks, and build triggers.","Used a string | options object union type for the async resolver signature, maintaining full backward compatibility with existing callers.","Created test symlinks with relative targets (../real-pkg/openclaw.mjs) rather than absolute paths, matching how nvm/fnm actually create their symlinks in production.","Wrapped symlink creation in tests with try/catch + skip for Windows environments without symlink privileges, ensuring CI stability."]},{"heading":"Impact & Takeaways","body":"This contribution reinforced several principles I carry into every codebase. First, always trace the actual runtime values — the bug was invisible in static analysis because path.resolve() looks correct until you realize argv[1] is a symlink. Second, look for existing patterns before inventing new ones — realpathSync was already used elsewhere in the project, making the fix immediately familiar to maintainers. Third, defensive coding matters — the try/catch around realpathSync means this fix literally cannot break existing functionality, only add new capability. The PR was submitted following all contribution guidelines including conventional commits, the project's Fix template, and full AI-assisted disclosure as required by CONTRIBUTING.md."}]},"prevPost":null,"nextPost":null}],["$L3"],"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
